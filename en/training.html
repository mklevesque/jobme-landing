              JobMe is not just about posting job offers. The ambition is to support talents in their growth:
              between applications, when preparing for an interview, structuring a CV, or clarifying a career plan.

                  while working, doing an internship or studying.

                  No. JobMe Training complements what you learn at school, at work,
                  or through self-learning. It’s a practical, short layer, very focused

                  with the basics and progress at your own pace.

                  Yes, some elements of your progress are visible on your profile
                  (badges, levels, key modules completed). The idea is not to grade you,

                  basic microlearning, first journeys, some key badges.
                  More advanced paths, deeper AI coaching or JobMe certifications
