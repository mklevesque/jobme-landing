              You can see JobMe as a three-step journey: <strong>set up your profile</strong>,

                <p class="how-block-subtitle">
                  You upload your CV or create it from scratch. The platform helps you organise your background,
                  avoid inconsistencies and highlight your experiences (internships, jobs, projects) in Ivory Coast or elsewhere.
                  A first CV template can be exported for free.

                <p class="how-block-subtitle">
                  You also add your preferences: city (Abidjan, Yamoussoukro, Bouaké, San-Pédro…), contract type,
                  remote or on-site, expected salary, seniority level. That’s the starting point for the AI matching

                <p class="how-block-subtitle">
                  You can use a <strong>classic job search</strong> (keywords, filters by industry,
                  contract, remote work, salary…) or switch to <strong>intelligent matching mode</strong> with swipe cards
                  on the offers published on the platform.

                <p class="how-block-subtitle">
                  Instead of scrolling through endless result pages, you see offers that match your profile.

                <p class="how-block-subtitle">
                  When you apply, JobMe keeps the history. You see if your CV was viewed,
                  if your application is progressing, if an interview is planned. You can communicate with recruiters
                  through messaging and keep a clear logbook of your job search.

                <p class="how-block-subtitle">
                  In short: you feel less like you’re sending CVs into the void, and more like you’re steering your own path.

                <p class="how-block-subtitle">
                  No. JobMe Candidates is for students, recent graduates, experienced profiles,
                  people in career transition or with non-linear paths. The AI looks at your potential and your story,
                  not just your current job title.

                <p class="how-block-subtitle">
                  Not at all. You can come with a rough CV or none at all. The platform helps you

                <p class="how-block-subtitle">
                  Part of it is free: profile creation, job search, basic matching, application tracking
                  and one exportable CV template. Some advanced options (additional templates, premium matching,
                  deeper AI guidance…) may be offered as paid features.

                <p class="how-block-subtitle">
                  You stay in control of your profile and CV visibility. You can hide your profile from your current employer,
