            <p class="section-subtext">
              JobMe Recruiters is an <strong>AI-powered recruitment platform</strong> designed from Ivory Coast,
              starting from what happens on the ground: lack of time, difficulty qualifying applications,
              and a need for visibility on what really works in your job ads.

                <p class="why-text">
                  Instead of receiving dozens of unqualified CVs, you mainly see talents that are aligned
                  with your criteria. The AI helps filter, but you always keep the final say on which profiles you select.

                  JobMe is based on the practices and constraints of the Ivorian market: roles in Abidjan and major cities,
                  diverse sectors, on-site roles, partial remote work, realistic salary ranges, and more.

            <p class="section-subtext">
              You can see JobMe as a three-step journey: <strong>set up your company space</strong>,
              <strong>publish & match</strong>, then <strong>pilot your hiring</strong>.

                <p class="how-block-subtitle">
                  You create a dedicated space for your organisation: description, industry, location,
                  size, values, employer brand. You can invite other recruiters or managers to join
                  with different roles (HR admin, recruiter, viewer).

                <p class="how-block-subtitle">
                  This space becomes your recruitment hub in Ivory Coast: all your offers,
                  candidates, talent pools and stats are centralised there.

                <p class="how-block-subtitle">
                  You create a job by entering the role, location, contract type, salary range,
                  required skills, perks, languages, start date and context.
                </p>
                <p class="how-block-subtitle">
                  The AI can help you generate or rewrite the job description from a simple title
                  or an existing document. Once published, JobMe starts suggesting matches to talents
                  and prioritising applications for you.

                <p class="how-block-subtitle">
                  Each job has a visual pipeline: new candidates, our selection for you,
                  to review, shortlist, interview, hired, rejected. You can annotate, favourite,
                  and move candidates from one stage to another.
                </p>
                <p class="how-block-subtitle">
                  Simple stats help you track the performance of each job post
                  and understand what attracts (or doesn’t attract) talents on the Ivorian market.
